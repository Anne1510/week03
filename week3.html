		<p><strong>Among Us </strong> is an online multiplayer social deduction game developed and published by <em>American game studio Innersloth</em>. It was released on iOS and Android devices in June 2018 and on Microsoft Windows in November 2018, featuring cross-platform play between these platforms.</p>

		<p>The game takes place in a space-themed setting, in which players each take on one of two roles, most being Crewmates, and a predetermined number being Impostors. The goal of the Crewmates is to identify the Impostors, eliminate them, and complete tasks around the map; the Impostors' goal is to covertly sabotage and kill the Crewmates before they complete all of their tasks. Players suspected to be Impostors may be eliminated via a plurality vote, which any player may initiate by calling an emergency meeting (except during a crisis) or reporting a dead body. Crewmates win if all Impostors are eliminated or all tasks are completed whereas Impostors win if there is an equal number of Impostors and Crewmates, or if a critical sabotage goes unresolved.</p>

		<p>While initially released in 2018 to little mainstream attention, it received an influx of popularity in 2020 due to many well-known Twitch streamers and YouTubers playing it. In response to the game's popularity, Among Us 2 was announced in August 2020. However, the planned sequel was canceled a month later and the team shifted their focus to improving the original game, with a release on the Nintendo Switch in December 2020 and planned releases for the Xbox One and Xbox Series X and Series S in 2021. Among Us has inspired internet memes and achieved a large following online.</p>

		<h2><center>Gameplay</center></h2>
		<p>Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to ten players. One to three players (depending on what the host selected) are chosen to be the impostor(s) each round. A game can take place on one of three maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld", a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ", or a planet base called "Polus"</p>

		<p>At the start of the game, Crewmates are given "tasks" to complete around the map in the form of minigames, consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as electrical rewiring and engine refueling. Impostors are given a fake list of tasks to blend in with Crewmates, although they are unable to actually complete any task. Impostors can sabotage vital systems, covertly travel through air vents, and work with other Impostors to kill Crewmates. If a player dies, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, are invisible to everyone except other ghosts, and are limited in their capacity to interact with the world; however, dead Crewmates must still complete their tasks. If an Impostor dies from being voted off, they can still sabotage to help the other Impostor(s).All players except ghosts have a limited cone of vision, only allowing them to see other players within a certain unblocked distance around them.</p>
		
		<p>The Crewmates win by completing all tasks, or by identifying and eliminating all Impostors. The Impostors win when the number of Impostors is equal to the number of Crewmates, or when a sabotage countdown reaches zero. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing sabotages (as an Impostor). When an Impostor performs a sabotage, either there is an immediate consequence (such as all the lights being turned off) or a countdown begins. In the latter case, if the sabotage is not resolved before the countdown finishes, the Impostors win. Sabotages can be resolved by living players in varying ways depending on which sabotage is performed.Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition; a player quitting is equivalent to them being eliminated, and a Crewmate quitting leads to their tasks being considered completed for the total.</p>
		
		<p>To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems in each map, such as a security camera system on The Skeld, a doorlog in MIRA HQ, and a vitals indicator in Polus. Crewmates may also confirm their identity through visual tasks, which cannot be faked by Impostors. Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing a button in the map at any time (except when a sabotage is in progress).This halts all other gameplay. In the meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available evidence.A plurality vote is held, and the chosen player is ejected from the map and dies. Players can communicate in a text chat, but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time). While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord while playing.</p>

		<p>In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as the vision range of the Crewmates and the Impostors, and the allowed number of emergency meetings. There are also many cosmetic options, including spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets,some of which are paid downloadable content.</p>
